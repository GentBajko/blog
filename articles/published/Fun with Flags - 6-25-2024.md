I've recently come into contact with Flag Enums in Python, and it has honestly blown my mind how much time and effort they've saved me on DiceMaster. They have significantly lowered the complexity of some data structures, reduced database complexity and space requirements, and enhanced code readability and maintainability.

For those unfamiliar with flag enums, they are a special type of enum in Python that allows for the combination of multiple values using bitwise operations. This makes it easy to handle multiple flags or settings in a clean, efficient way. An easy to understand use-case would be user permissions on an app:

```python
from enum import Flag, auto

class UserPermissions(Flag):
    READ = auto()
    WRITE = auto()
    EXECUTE = auto()
    DELETE = auto()

# Combining permissions
user_permissions = UserPermissions.READ | UserPermissions.WRITE

# Checking permissions
if UserPermissions.READ in user_permissions:
    print("User has read permission")
if UserPermissions.WRITE in user_permissions:
    print("User has write permission")
if UserPermissions.EXECUTE in user_permissions:
    print("User has execute permission")
if UserPermissions.DELETE in user_permissions:
    print("User has delete permission")

# Adding a permission
user_permissions |= UserPermissions.DELETE

# Removing a permission
user_permissions &= ~UserPermissions.WRITE

print(f"Current permissions: {user_permissions}")
```
